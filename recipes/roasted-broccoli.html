    <h4>The best oven-roasted-broccoli you will ever make!</h4>
        <p>When I was a small girl growing up on my grand-parents farm, my GiGi always brought out this dish for most family gatherings and I have always loved it!

        </p>
        <h5>Ingredients:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>2 stalks of fresh broccoli</li>
            <li>3-5 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>2 Tbps olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated parmasean cheese</li>
            <li>Salt & Pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Steps:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat your oven to 425 degrees. Cut your broccoli into bite-sized pieces and wash them. Make sure to pat the broccoli dry with paper towels to remove excess water.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, mix together the broccoli, olive oil, garlic, and salt & pepper.</li>
            <li>Spread the mix out onto a tinfoil-lined cookie sheet in an even layer.</li>
            <li>Place the sheet in the oven and bake for about 10-12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Take the sheet out of the oven and flip/stir the broccoli and then sprinkle the parmasean cheese all over.</li>
            <li>Bake for another 7-10 minutes or until the cheese is melted and the broccoli is nice and golden-brown.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
